An Animusic-inspired machine that plays classical music with marbles.

Inspired by the viral Animusic video "Pipe Dream" ([watch it on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCIpKAIFyo)) and [Euphony](https://github.com/qiao/euphony) by Xueqiao Xu ([qiao](https://github.com/qiao)).

Made with help from:

* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js)
* [jasmid](https://github.com/gasman/jasmid)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)

A lot of the code and _all_ of the pieces are from [Euphony](https://github.com/qiao/euphony). So you should seriously check that out if haven't done so already.

Sadly, because it requires high-precision MIDI playing, this demo only works in Chrome. In addition, it requires WebGL and doesn't seem to work on older computers.
